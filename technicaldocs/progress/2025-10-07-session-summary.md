# Session Summary - October 7, 2025

## Phases Completed

### Phase 10: Main App & Routing ✅
- Created `src/App.tsx` with complete routing architecture
- Implemented BrowserRouter with conditional routing
- Added Firebase auth state listener
- Implemented three-tier routing logic:
  - Not authenticated → Login page
  - Authenticated, no profile → User selection
  - Authenticated with profile → Dashboard/Equipment routes
- Added `handleUserSelected` and `handleChangeUser` callbacks
- Loading spinner during auth check

### Phase 11: Firestore Security Rules ✅
- Configured `firestore.rules` with authentication checks
- Deployed rules for all collections:
  - Equipment collection
  - Equipment critWalks subcollection
  - Equipment status collection
  - Assignments collection
- Command: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

### Phase 12: Storage Security Rules ✅
- Configured `storage.rules` for photo uploads
- Path: `equipment/{equipmentId}/critwalks/{critWalkId}/{filename}`
- Deployed with `firebase deploy --only storage`

### Phase 13: Build & Deploy Configuration ✅
- Verified `vite.config.ts` (output: dist, sourcemap: false)
- Verified `firebase.json` (SPA rewrites, hosting config)
- Verified package scripts (dev, build, preview, deploy)
- All configuration complete and tested
