## üñºÔ∏è Photo Viewing System Overhaul

### ImageLightbox Component
**Created:** `src/components/common/ImageLightbox.tsx`

**Features:**
- Full-screen modal overlay with dark background
- Large, centered image display with proper sizing
- Navigation controls:
  - Left/right arrow buttons
  - Keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, ESC)
  - Touch swipe gestures for mobile
- Photo counter display (e.g., "1 / 3")
- Click outside to close
- Prevents body scroll when open

**Technical Implementation:**
- Touch event handlers for swipe detection
- Keyboard event listeners for navigation
- Proper z-index stacking
- Responsive padding for desktop and mobile

### Thumbnail Display Fixes
**File:** `src/components/critWalk/CritWalkHistory.tsx`

**Issues Fixed:**
- Black thumbnail rendering (overlay stacking problem)
- Images not displaying correctly
- Over-zoom in lightbox view

**Solutions Applied:**
- Changed from `aspect-square` with fixed height to proper aspect ratio
- Fixed z-index stacking: image (`z-0`), overlay (`z-10`)
- Removed problematic `bg-black bg-opacity-0` causing black display
- Changed to `group-hover:bg-black group-hover:bg-opacity-30`
- Added `absolute inset-0` positioning for images
- Improved hover effects with magnifying glass icon

**Visual Improvements:**
- Enhanced thumbnail grid layout (2-3-4 columns responsive)
- Smooth transitions and hover states
- Shadow effects on cards
- Consistent rounded corners

## üì± Mobile Memory Crisis - Image Compression

### The Problem
**Error:** "Unable to complete previous operation due to low memory"

**Root Cause:**
- Modern phone cameras: 12MP+ photos (5-15MB each)
- App loading full-resolution images for previews
- No compression before upload
- Mobile browsers exhausting RAM

### The Solution

#### Upload Compression
**File:** `src/services/storage.service.ts`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const optimizeImage = async (file: File): Promise<Blob> => {
  // Canvas-based compression
  // Max dimensions: 1920x1920
  // Quality: 85%
  // Result: ~500KB-1MB per photo
}
```

**Results:**
- **Before:** 8MB photo uploaded
- **After:** 0.7MB photo uploaded
- **Reduction:** 90% memory savings

#### Preview Compression
**File:** `src/components/critWalk/PhotoUpload.tsx`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const createCompressedPreview = (file: File): Promise<string> => {
  // Canvas-based preview generation
  // Max dimensions: 400x400
  // Quality: 70%
  // Result: ~50KB per preview
}
```

**Results:**
- **Before:** 8MB preview in memory
- **After:** 50KB preview in memory
- **Reduction:** 98% memory savings

**Impact:**
- Eliminates "low memory" errors on mobile
- Faster uploads on slow connections
- Reduced data usage for technicians
- Console logs show compression stats

## üóëÔ∏è Automated Photo Cleanup System

### Cloud Function Implementation
**Created:** `functions/src/index.ts`

**Function:** `cleanupOldCritWalks`

**Schedule:**
- Runs daily at midnight Central Time (DFW7 timezone)
- Cron expression: `0 0 * * *`

**Functionality:**
```typescript
export const cleanupOldCritWalks = onSchedule({
  schedule: "0 0 * * *",
  timeZone: "America/Chicago"
}, async (event) => {
  // 1. Calculate cutoff (30 days ago)
  // 2. Query old crit walks
  // 3. Delete photos from Firebase Storage
  // 4. Delete Firestore documents
  // 5. Log results
});
```

**What Gets Deleted:**
- Crit walk documents older than 30 days
- Associated photos from Firebase Storage
- Maintains recent data for active use

**Safety Features:**
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging for audit trail
- Non-destructive (only deletes old data)
- Automatic retry on failure

**Cost Analysis:**
- Runs 30 times/month
- Free tier: 2M invocations/month
- **Monthly cost: $0.00** (well within free tier)

### Firebase Setup
**Initialized:**
- Cloud Functions for Firebase (2nd Gen)
- TypeScript configuration
- Build and deployment scripts

**Configuration:**
- Container cleanup policy: 30 days
- Node.js 22 runtime
- Max instances: 10 (cost control)

**Deployed Successfully:**
- Function URL: `cleanupOldCritWalks(us-central1)`
- Status: Active and scheduled

## üñ®Ô∏è Equipment Category Addition

**File:** `src/data/teamMembers.ts`

**Change:**
Added "Printers" to `EQUIPMENT_CATEGORIES` array

**New Categories List:**
1. HVAC
2. Conveyor System
3. Electrical
4. Forklift
5. Dock Equipment
6. Safety Equipment
7. **Printers** ‚Üê New
8. Other

**Impact:**

## üö® Failure Tracking System - Planning & Phase 1

### Feature Planning
**Created:** `technicaldocs/plan/failure-tracking-feature.md`

**Comprehensive Plan Includes:**
- User stories (technician and manager workflows)
- Data model specifications
- UI/UX mockups and wireframes
- 6 implementation phases (12-18 hours total)
- Technical considerations
- Mobile UX guidelines
- Success metrics
- Timeline estimates

**Key Features Planned:**
1. **Failure Flagging**
   - Technicians mark issues during crit walk
   - Link Work Order numbers to failures
   - Visual indicators on dashboard

2. **Comment System**
   - Discussion threads on crit walks
   - Manager and technician communication
   - Timestamp and author tracking

3. **Resolution Tracking**
   - Mark failures as resolved
   - Audit trail (who resolved, when)
   - Active failure count per equipment

4. **Dashboard Visibility**
   - Color-coded flags on equipment cards
   - Filter for flagged equipment only
   - Failure count indicators

### Phase 1 Implementation - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

#### TypeScript Type Updates

**File:** `src/types/critWalk.types.ts`
```typescript
// Added to CritWalk interface:
hasFailure: boolean;
workOrderNumber?: string;
failureResolvedAt?: Timestamp | null;
failureResolvedBy?: string;
comments?: CritWalkComment[];

// New interface:
export interface CritWalkComment {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
}

// Updated CritWalkFormData:
hasFailure?: boolean;
workOrderNumber?: string;
```

**File:** `src/types/equipment.types.ts`
```typescript
// Added to EquipmentStatus interface:
hasActiveFailure: boolean;
activeFailureCount: number;
lastFailureAt?: Timestamp | null;
```

#### Service Layer Updates

**File:** `src/services/critWalk.service.ts`

**Updated Functions:**
1. **createCritWalk**
   - Now accepts `hasFailure` and `workOrderNumber` from form
   - Initializes failure fields on new crit walks
   - Passes failure status to equipment status update

2. **updateEquipmentStatus** (internal)
   - Tracks active failure count
   - Increments when failure is flagged
   - Updates `hasActiveFailure` and `lastFailureAt` timestamps

**New Functions:**
3. **updateCritWalkFailureStatus**
   - Marks failure as resolved
   - Records who resolved and when
   - Decrements active failure count on equipment
   - Updates `hasActiveFailure` when count reaches 0

4. **addCritWalkComment**
   - Adds comment to crit walk using Firestore `arrayUnion`
   - Includes timestamp and author
   - Maintains comment history

**File:** `src/services/equipment.service.ts`

**Updated:** `createEquipment` function
- Initializes failure tracking fields when creating equipment:
  ```typescript
  hasActiveFailure: false,
  activeFailureCount: 0,
  lastFailureAt: null
  ```

#### Build Verification
‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
‚úÖ No type errors
‚úÖ All imports resolved correctly
‚úÖ Ready for Phase 2 (UI implementation)
