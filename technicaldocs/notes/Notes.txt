Will this current plan allow for live data? If manager has dashboard open is it updated constantly so they have live data?


May need to remove development Philosophy

Pitch: I am using what I learned in school to solve inefficiencies I see at work. Currently
there is no clear visibility for the completion of critwalks. It is currently tracked over manually
slack groups that clutter our slack console. Also, anyone working on critwalks doesn't have a central 
point to see the status of the completions. With a central dashboard any manager and any tech
can get up to date information and can assign techs to crit walks that have beene misseed. 
Techs can also easily determine if some have been missed and provide coverage when needed.
